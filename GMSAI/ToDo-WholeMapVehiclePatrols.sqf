TODO List:

	1. have these go fast outside cities, slower inside // 
	2. dont have them stop inside cities, instead have the peruse the area (location) for a short while
	3. Will need to track name of location so we can pull the dimensions 
	4. thus, waypoints could flip between perusing an area and going to the next place 
	5. add more robust hunting, like hovering near dead players a while (5 min) and snooping about when a player is detected trying to find them.
