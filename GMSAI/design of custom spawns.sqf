1. Allow three types of custom spawns: Air, Vehicle, Infantry, all spawned on/over land.
2. Configure each custom-spawned patrol to patrol an area defined by a marker.
3. Use the same logic employed for active/inactive static infantry patrols to handle Air and Vehicle patrols.
4. Just add custom infantry patrols to the existing cue with a custom descriptor.
