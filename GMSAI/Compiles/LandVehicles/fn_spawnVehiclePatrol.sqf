/*
	GMS_fnc_spawnVehiclePatrol 
	Purpose: spawn a vehicle patrol that will go from location to location on the map or patrols a proscribed area hunting for players 
	
		Parameters: 
		_pos,  			center of the region in which the group will operate 
		_patrolType, 	"Map" or Region, where region would be am area proscribed by a marker defined by center, size and shape 
		_blackListed     positions to be avoided formated as [[x,y,z], radious]
		_center			the center of the patrol area or map center if the mode is "Map"
		_size			The size of the patrol area or mapsize if the mode is "Map" 
		_shape			Normally, this is a rectangle 
		_timeout		how quickly the group is sent back if it wanders out of the mission area.
		_isSubmersible  true/false  When true, and if the vehicle is on or in water, it will be set to move below the surface 
		
	Returns: [_group,_vehicle]
		_group ( the group spawned) 
		_vehicle (the vehicle spawned)

	Notes:
		Locations: are any town, city etc defined at startup.
		when '_isSubmersible == true the script will assume it should set swimInDepth as well
		Locations: are any town, city etc defined at startup.
