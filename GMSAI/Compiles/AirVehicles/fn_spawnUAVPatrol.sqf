	GMS_fnc_spawnUAVPatrol 
	Purpose: spawn a UAV patrol that will go from location to location on the map hunting for players 

	Parameters: 
	Parameters: 
		_pos, position to spawn chopper 
		_patrolArea - can be "Map" or "Region". "Region will respect the boundaries of a map marker while Map will patrol the entire map. 
		_blackListed - areas to avoid formated as [[x,y,z],radius]
		_center, center of the area, either mapCenter of center of the patrol area 
		_size, size of the area to be patroled, either mapSize or dimension of the patrol area 
		_shape, shap of the patrol area (rectangle by default)
		_timeout - how long to wait before deciding the chopper is 'stuck'

	Returns: [
		_group, the group spawned to man the heli 
		_uav, the UAV spawned selected by selectRandomWeighted GMSAI_aircraftTypes,  
	]
